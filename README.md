The gym trainer in Escape from Tarkov is a minigame that trains your character.

In the game, the player is presented with a small hexagon inside a bigger hexagon.
Each round, the bigger hexagon shrinks quickly and the player must click when the bigger hexagon is inside the hexagon.
As the rounds progress, the smaller hexagon gets smaller, the line on the hexagon gets thinner and the bigger hexagon travels faster.

If the player successfully clicks when the big hexagon is inside the small hexagon, the player's character performs a weights rep and the strength stat goes up.
If the player doesn't click successfully, there's no stat gain and there's a chance of a broken limb which impacts the character's abilities.

I was very bad at this game so i wrote a script in Python to do it for me.
